# 🧠 42 C++ Modules

Welcome to the **42 C++ Modules** repository! This project is a part of the 42 Cursus and is designed to progressively introduce and deepen the understanding of the C++ programming language—from its most basic syntax and OOP principles to advanced topics like templates, STL, and performance optimization.

Each module builds upon the knowledge of the previous one, reinforcing C++ fundamentals while exploring new concepts.

## 📚 Modules Overview

Here’s a high-level summary of what you’ll find in each module:

### 🚀 CPP00 - Basics of C++

- Introduction to C++ syntax, namespaces, and I/O streams.
- Understanding basic classes, member functions, and attributes.
- First look at OOP in C++.

### 🚀 CPP01 - Memory and References

- Stack vs heap, pointers, and references.
- File I/O and working with streams.
- Deeper exploration of object handling.

### 🚀 CPP02 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism

- Operator overloading and fixed-point arithmetic.
- Introduction to static polymorphism and class interactions.

### 🚀 CPP03 - Inheritance Basics

- Creating base and derived classes.
- Constructors, destructors, and the importance of inheritance.

### 🚀 CPP04 - Abstract Classes and Polymorphism

- Pure virtual functions, interfaces, and deep copies.
- Dynamic polymorphism with base class references/pointers.

### 🚀 CPP05 - Exceptions and Operator Overload

- Custom exceptions and safe error handling.
- More operator overloading with practical use cases.

### 🚀 CPP06 - Type Conversion and RTTI

- Casting (`static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, etc.) and runtime type identification.
- Polymorphism safety and serialization logic.

### 🚀 CPP07 - Templates

- Function and class templates.
- Generic programming and type-agnostic utilities.

### 🚀 CPP08 - STL Containers and Iterators

- Using `vector`, `list`, `deque`, and iterators.
- Functors, algorithms, and container-based design.

### 🚀 CPP09 - Performance and Container Efficiency

- Parsing and sorting with `list`, `deque`, and `map`.
- Time complexity awareness and performance comparison.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each module is organized into its own folder:

```
/CPP00
/CPP01
...
/CPP09
```

Each module contains a `README.md` explaining its goals, topics, and exercises, along with the source code.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++98 standard compliance.
- Use `make` for all compilations.
- Proper memory management (no leaks).
- Follow the Orthodox Canonical Form where required.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

This repository is not only a learning journey through the C++ language but also a solid preparation for real-world development. By the end of CPP09, you’ll have touched most of the foundational and intermediate concepts in C++.

Happy coding and keep improving! 🚀
