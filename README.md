# 🧠 42 Cursus - C++ Module 01

## 📌 Description

The C++ Module 01 is designed to introduce more advanced features of C++, focusing on the foundational topics that every C++ programmer needs to master. In this module, we learned about classes, dynamic memory allocation, constructors, destructors, and object-oriented programming principles.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- **Classes**: Defining and using classes, constructors, destructors.
- **Encapsulation**: Access control with private, public, and protected members.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `new`, `delete`, and `new[]`.
- **Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator**: How to copy objects correctly.
- **Overloading**: Operator overloading and function overloading.
- **Memory Management**: Smart pointers, RAII, and avoiding memory leaks.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Principles like abstraction and inheritance.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each exercise is located in its own directory and is independent of others. You will have to compile each exercise individually using:

```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror <file>.cpp -o <executable>
```

## 🧪 Exercises

### 📌 Exercise 00 - `BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ`

In this exercise, the Zombie class manages a private name attribute and can announce itself with a specific message. It includes two functions: newZombie for creating a heap-allocated zombie, and randomChump for stack-allocated zombies that announce immediately, with destructors handling cleanup.

### 📌 Exercise 01 - `Moar brainz!`

The zombieHorde function allocates N Zombie objects in a single memory block, names them, and returns a pointer to the first zombie. The zombies should announce themselves, and proper memory management must be ensured by deleting the zombies and checking for memory leaks.

### 📌 Exercise 02 - `HI THIS IS BRAIN`

The program initializes a string and demonstrates the use of a pointer and a reference to that string. It then prints the memory addresses and values of the string, pointer, and reference, showcasing how address manipulation works.

### 📌 Exercise 03 - `Unnecessary violence`

The program involves creating a `Weapon` class with methods to get and set its type, followed by two classes, `HumanA` and `HumanB`, each equipped with a weapon and a name. The main task is to model the differences in how `HumanA` and `HumanB` manage their weapons (with `HumanA` always armed and `HumanB` potentially not), while ensuring correct memory management and handling potential memory leaks.


### 📌 Exercise 04 - `Sed is for losers`

The program takes a filename and two strings, opens the file, and creates a new file with the name <filename>.replace. It then copies the content from the original file, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2 without using C file manipulation functions or std::string::replace. Proper error handling for unexpected inputs and file operations is required.

### 📌 Exercise 05 - `Harl 2.0`

The program creates a Harl class with private member functions for each complaint level (debug, info, warning, error). The public function complain takes a level string as a parameter and calls the corresponding private function without using multiple if/else statements, but instead using pointers to member functions to automate the complaints.

### 📌 Exercise 06 - `Harl filter`

he program implements a filtering system for Harl's complaints based on a given log level. The program takes one of the four levels as a parameter and displays all complaints from that level and above. It uses a switch statement to filter out messages, and if an invalid level is passed, it displays a default message about insignificant complaints

## 🛠️ Compilation

Compile the exercises with the following command to ensure no warnings or errors:

```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror <file>.cpp -o <executable>
```

---

## ✅ Code Guidelines

- [ ] Code is clean, well-organized, and properly commented.
- [ ] No warnings when compiling with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- [ ] Proper implementation of constructors, destructors, and copy constructors.
- [ ] Use of `new` and `delete` for dynamic memory management.
- [ ] Proper use of private and public members, following encapsulation principles.
- [ ] Avoid memory leaks by correctly freeing allocated memory.
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions: `CamelCase` for class names, `snake_case` for functions/variables.
- [ ] Correct implementation of object-oriented principles (inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction).

## 🏁 Conclusion

Module 01 builds on the concepts introduced in Module 00 and dives deeper into object-oriented programming in C++. By the end of this module, we had a good understanding of how to use classes, manage dynamic memory, and apply basic OOP principles in your C++ programs.
